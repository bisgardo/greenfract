# Greenfract

A slightly shined up version of a very old project implemented in Greenfoot for drawing fractals.

The project might be useful as a learning tool for both Greenfoot/Java and fractal rendering. There's also plenty of extension opportunities for both performance, user experience, and output.

As an example of extension options, the project was used in a graduate CS course on digital audio, where a sound server interpreted the computated values as frequencies.
